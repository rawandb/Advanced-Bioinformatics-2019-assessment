## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
#Task 3.1 
```{r}

#Task 3.2 
```{r}

#for 10 
sumfun(10)
#for 20 
sumfun(20)
#for 100

```
#Task 3.3 
```{r}

  Fibonacci <- numeric(n)
  Fibonacci[1]<- 1 
  Fibonacci [2]<- 1 
  x=3 
  while(x <=n){
    Fibonacci[x]=Fibonacci[x-1] + Fibonacci[x-2]
    x<- x+1 
  }
  return(Fibonacci)

#Task 3.4 
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x= as.factor(gear), y= mpg)) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill= as.factor(gear) )) + ggtitle(" Box plot For Miles per gallon(mpg) as a function of number of gears")
```

#Task 3.5 
```{r}
#assign the Y and X variables to the dataset 
y <- 1/cars $dist; x <- cars $speed; 
#assign linear model function to model variable 
model <- lm(formula = "y ~ x")
#stats of the linear model 
summary(model)
```
#slope = -0.007933 std. error = 0.001708
#intercept =  0.167248 std. error =  0.027788

#Task 3.6
```{r}
library(ggplot2) 
#create ggplot_N variable to plot the ggplot2 function, add title, and axises labels 
ggplot_N <- ggplot(data = cars, aes(x= speed, y=dist)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm",formula = "y ~ x")+ ggtitle ("Linear Relationship between breaking distance and speed")+ xlab("speed")+ ylab("dist")

```
#task 3.7 
```{r}
#convert distance from feet to meters by x by 0.3048 meters in a foot 
dist_m <- cars$dist* 0.3048
#convert speed from hours to seconds

```
# reaction time is very very small - might be unreasonable 
#plot the dataset to find fitted relationship
```{r}
